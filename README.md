# SoilMoistureSensor
We will be targeting farmers in North America, with a priority on the Western and Central USA and Southern Canada. We will be targeting farmers with a priority on wheat and alfalfa farmers, as both are some of the most water-intensive crops. Wheat is also an important source of revenue for Canada. Our tool is affordable, so we will target small farming businesses and monopolies. Farmers and civilians in many parts of North America are suffering from the effects of drought. Droughts may affect the yields of crops which endangers careers in the agricultural sector. Water-intensive crops, such as wheat, are especially sensitive and prone to damage caused by low moisture. With no way to accurately monitor and measure soil moisture levels, farmers are at risk of losing revenue and product. Dry conditions are also hazards, as they are a leading cause of wildfires. If crops and products catch fire, the product that was ignited is a complete loss for the farmer, no matter how big or small the fire is.
